## Tools

* Testfairy
* Google Analytics for A/B tests in your real app
* Play Store/Google+ for beta testing

## Methodology

* Record user sessions using a video camera
  (better than screen sharing on mobile devices)
* 5 users catch enough bugs to fix in a while
* Hallway testing -- ask random strangers
* offer bug bounties and easy feedback channels
* people get bug-blind if they test the same app too often
* A/B tests
* Eye tracking to detect where users get stuck
* Test early in the design process, even on sketches only
* Test with users that are used to other platforms as well (i.e. iOS users)
